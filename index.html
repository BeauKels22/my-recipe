    A luscious, creamy pie loaded with strawberries, drizzled with chocolate, on a sweet graham cracker crust. A pie that’s so rich, so decadent, yet somehow so light that every bite just melts in your mouth.  Mmmmmm. I've made this dish about 4 times for family events and within minutes, it's gone! That's how good it is!
